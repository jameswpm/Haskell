# Haskell
Repository to store some Haskell exercises and little projects

This repository is created just to store my Haskell code, both for any online course in this  programming language or for little projects (most of them for didatic purposes).

You can use and copy anything from here, if you want. Feel free.

##Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!

You can buy or read this incredible book [here](http://learnyouahaskell.com/). It's a introductory book  to functional programming created for developers of other programming paradigms.

Keep a eye in these [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5a9l1Td2Lo&list=PL0zVEGEvSaeG37ziHqYumYgvJDBn1Wsap) too.

The directory LearnYouAHaskell contains some example code from the book.
